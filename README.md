## Classification_fish_species - (using WxLxHxWeight)

### Problem Statement:

What is the most effective model to identify the species of fish using weight, length, height, width of the fish? 


```python

```

#### Executive Summary:

Major fish distributors are looking to automate there system.  There goal is to have their fish shipped and sold before it ever leaves the boad. The fish weighed and measured automatically while still at sea, this data will be sent back to the offices where from this data the company will know what varieties of fish are in the ships hold and make arrangmets for it to be sold. They are looking to see if identifying the fish can be done via the weight, height, length, and width of the fish.  They are also look to see which model would give them the highest level of accuracy in doing this.

### Process:

 - all data has been normalized and scalled 

To identify the species of fish using the metrics of weight, length, height, width we have created 3 different models using various technics.
- we have used a Logistic Regression Model 
- we have used a Random Forest model
- we have created a Neural Network

#### Conclution

In conclution, it is possible to identiy a fish species by the weight, height, length, and width.  In doing so Logistic Regression with a HyperPeramter of C = 100 gives extreally accurate results.  Returning an accuracy score of .95.
